Create your application

In the Redirect URIs column, use a link to your Telegram profile.

For example
```
https://t.me/athlo9sky
```

Where it says "Which API/SDKs are you planning to use?"

Check all the boxes.

Then go to the settings of our created application and copy the data to our file.

Specifically:
Client ID
Client secret
Redirect URIs

Then we go here and log in.
```
https://my.telegram.org/
```
Fill in all the fields.

Go to the tab "API development tools"

Copy 2 fields into our file:
App api_id
App api_hash

And enter your phone number.

Launch our app, we will be asked to enter the link the app sent us to. This link will be your telegram profile. Copy all the characters from the search bar. 
And also allow access to our Spotify.
Done.
